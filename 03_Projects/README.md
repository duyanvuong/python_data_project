# Project Overview

After taking a Python course on Youtube, I want to build this project to demonstrate how far I understand Python and apply Python in cleaning, analyzing, plotting in Exploratory Data Analysis.

In this project, I used a dataset that I found on Hugging Face ([dataset source here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs)). The dataset "data_jobs" hosted on Hugging Face is focused on data-related job listings. It includes job titles, companies, locations, employment types, and job descriptions. The dataset can be used to analyze trends in the data job market, understand common requirements, or explore salary distributions. It is beneficial for those studying the labor market in the tech industry, especially data science and related fields.

# Questions

1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What is the most optimal skill to learn for Data Analysts? (High Demand AND High Paying)
